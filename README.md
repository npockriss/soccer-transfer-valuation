# Soccer Transfer Value Predictor

## OVERVIEW
A Machine Learning Project that predicts the market value of soccer players based on performance stats (Goals, Assists, Minutes) and traits (age)

## Findings (So Far)
* **Market Inefficiency:** Identified that the model under-predicts values for high-potential youth players (e.g., Cole Palmer)
* **Drivers of Value:** "Goals" and "Minutes Played" are the strongest predictors but League Strength and Position are missing variables

## Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Data:** Transfermarkt data (2024-2025 Season)
